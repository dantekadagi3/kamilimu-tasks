# 1.What is a programming paradgim:
This is a style ,approach or structure of programming that defines how to write the code, how to organize the code, how to use the data

# 2.How is Object-Oriented Programming different from Procedural Programming?
Object-Oriented Programming is different from Procedural Programming in the following ways:
- In OOP, we define the data and the methods that operate on that data within a class
- In Procedural Programming, we define the data and the methods that operate on that data separately
- In OOP, we use objects and classes to organize the code
- In Procedural Programming, we use procedures and functions to organize the code.

# 3.Give one real-world analogy for Functional Programming.
Functional Programming is like a recipe book. Just like how a recipe book has a list of ingredients and a list of steps to prepare a dish, Functional Programming has a list of inputs and a list of functions that operate on those inputs to produce a result.

# 4.Why might someone choose Declarative code over Procedural in UI development?
 Because Declarative code is more concise and easier to read, making it ideal for complex UI development where the code needs to be readable and maintainable.
 So:ease,readability and maintainability
