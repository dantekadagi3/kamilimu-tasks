# 1.What is a programming paradgim:
This is a style ,approach or structure of programming that defines how to write the code, how to organize the code, how to use the data

# 2.How is Object-Oriented Programming different from Procedural Programming?
Object-Oriented Programming is different from Procedural Programming in the following ways:
- In OOP, we define the data and the methods that operate on that data within a class
- In Procedural Programming, we define the data and the methods that operate on that data separately
- In OOP, we use objects and classes to organize the code
- In Procedural Programming, we use procedures and functions to organize the code.

# 3.Give one real-world analogy for Functional Programming.
Functional Programming is like a recipe book. Just like how a recipe book has a list of ingredients and a list of steps to prepare a dish, Functional Programming has a list of inputs and a list of functions that operate on those inputs to produce a result.

# 4.Why might someone choose Declarative code over Procedural in UI development?
 Because Declarative code is more concise and easier to read, making it ideal for complex UI development where the code needs to be readable and maintainable.
 So:ease,readability and maintainability


# 5.Match each of the following real-world use cases to the most appropriate paradigm. Write your answers in answers.md, and briefly justify each choice.

##1. Building a complex UI with reusable components 
Declarative
Because Declarative code is more concise and easier to read, making it ideal for complex UI development

##2. Writing a short script to automate image resizing
Procedural
Procedural code is more suitable for short scripts that need to perform a series of steps to achieve a result.

##3. Creating a math utility library thatâ€™s easy to test and reuse
Functional
Functional Programming is ideal for creating reusable code that can be easily tested and composed together.

##4 . Modeling different types of bank accounts with shared and custom rules
Object-Oriented Programming
OOP allows you to  create blueprints of objects that can have their own properties and methods, this will prevent repetition of code and writing new code for each new type of bank account.

## 6.Why I chose OOP for my todo list app
I chose OOP for my todo list app because it allows me to create objects that can have their own properties and methods, this will prevent repetition of code and writing new code for each new todo item . It also allows me to create a blueprint of a todo item that can be easily reused throughout the app.

## 7.What are its tradeoffs or strengths?
The tradeoffs of OOP are:
- Steeper learning curve
- More complex code
- Over-engineering
The strengths:
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Reusability

## 8.Would your solution scale in a large team or codebase?
Yes, my solution would scale in a large team or codebase because it uses OOP principles such as encaplsulation making it easier to maintain and extend the code without having to rewrite the entire codebase.
